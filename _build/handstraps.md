## Cut materials

Cut the neoprene using the provided pattern. 

Cut two 12cm pieces off the black strap band.
From one of those pieces, cut away a diagonal piece so that it aligns with the relief the hand piece top has on its underside.

Cut another 10cm of the black strap band and put it into shape using the provided pattern for the small strap.

<div class="note">
The strap band will stay in shape if you melt together the fibres of freshly cut ends, e.g., with a lighter.

## Sew straps

Fix the 12cm band to the neoprene by needles with an overlap of about 4.5cm. Use the same overlap to attach the non-sticky part of the velcro to the other side of the neoprene such that the strap and the velcro "sandwich" the neoprene. 

Sew the three parts together by a cross overlaid with a square.
Sew a seam around the neoprene corners as well.

Attach the smaller strap to the neoprene in a similar manner.
