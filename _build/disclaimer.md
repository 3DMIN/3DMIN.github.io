## Dislaimer

The information on this page may be used to build a PushPull. However, before you start, be aware that PushPull is a carefully crafted product, mainly made by hand. To master its building process, you should already have experience in soldering electronic circuits, computer programming, operating rapid prototyping tools, sewing, wood works and general hand-crafting. 

Further, being patient with yourself and be willing to tinker helps in the process. There will be times where you need to redo steps to get a satisfying result.

PushPull was designed to be produced with facilities, workshops and tools available and familiar *to us*. This means that we made extensive use of the Lasercutter, the 3D printer, the wood- and metal-workshops, and PCB etching. Your skill set might be different and you are encouraged to alter the steps accordingly.
Some parts were produced externally by professional manufacturers (e.g. the multilayer PCBs, and the metal frame). We highly recommend to follow this in order to get good results.  

## Information

The presented *SE* revision of PushPull is the third iteration of the instrument and was developed within the [3DMIN Project](http://3DMIN.org).

By publicly documenting the development and building process, we preserve our knowledge and emphasize a central directive of publicly funded research: to expand knowledge and make it publicly available.

This page may serve as an inspiration for you. What will you build? What will you do different? What kind of instrument designs does it inspire?
We are more than happy to learn about your variation and add it to the page! Just write an [issue to the github page](https://github.com/3DMIN/3DMIN.github.io/issues/new) and we will get in contact with you. 

If you want to get a face-to-face introduction on building this extraordinary instrument as well as to be introduced to new sound patches and mappings, please contact one of us via [our](http://ameliehinrichsen.de) [web](http://himalo.de) [pages](http://tai-studio.org#contact) or via [twitter](https://twitter.com/3dminBerlin). Since we facilitated PushPull-building workshops in the past, we are happy to repeat it in one way or the other.
