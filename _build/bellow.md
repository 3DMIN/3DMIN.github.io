## Laser-cutting metal frames production.

<div class="note">Before laser-cutting, glue the mirror film to the cardboard.</div>

Load the provided file ```LasercutBellow.ai``` to your laser-cutter and try cut settings with a test piece of the material. Then, cut the sheet.

We got the metal frame professionally produced. All its holes need an M3 female screw threading.

![TODO: photo of laser-cut sheet and metal frames]()

## Coating preparation

<div class="note">You will need an assistant for the following steps.</div>

Cut transfer adhesive film to about ```50cm x 100cm``` and remove its protective sheet starting at one corner, pulling diagonally and almost parallel to the surface.

While one person positions the transparent film parallel to the end of the cut cardboard (mirrored side up!), the other holds up the other end.

<div class="note">The film should protrude the cardboard on every side.</div>

*While one person positions the transparent film parallel to the end of the cut cardboard (mirrored side up!), the other holds up the other end. The film should protrude the cardboard on every side.*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2480.jpg)
*Starting at one corner, wipe-press a cloth over the foil to stick it to the  cardboard. While brushing from left to right, move slowly from one end of the cardboard to the other.*

*cut mosquito netting to 50 x 100cm*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2201.jpg)
*apply adhesive spray to cardboard*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_1260.jpg)
*apply adhesive spray to mosquito netting*

<div class="note">Wait 10 minutes before mounting mosquito net on cardboard, adhesive spray needs to be dry</div>

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2525.jpg)
*Mount mosquito netting to the cardboard in the same way as you applied the transparent adhesive film before. Adjust its position by hand if necessary. Avoid wrinkles!*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_1276.jpg)
*Use a rubber roll to evenly apply pressure. Not the time but the amount of pressure determines the quality of the connection.*

## Coating

<div class="note">Put on vinyl gloves, and repeat coating three times. Thin layers of latex are better, wait for one layer to fully dry until you apply the next layer. This takes more or less 2 hours.</div>

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2619.jpg)
*tape material to working surface, it should be strapped with a proper amount of tension*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2231.jpg)
*Pour more or less 300m of liquid latex on material*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2235.jpg)
*spread liquid latex on surface evenly*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_1925.jpg)
*the more diagonal you hold the rubber spreader the easier you can spread the latex into the mosquito netting*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_1578.jpg)
*take care of the edges, they should be fully covered by latex.*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_1574.jpg)
*coated material, avoid dabs, if they happen spread them with your fingertip*



## Preparing putting

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2099.jpg)
*detach material from surface and cut along the edges*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2603.jpg)
*here as shown on the sides*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2395.jpg)
*here as shown on the bottom part*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/C0009T01.jpg)
*cut wholes into material with punch.*

![]()

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2124.jpg)
*Remove adhesive transfer film from the mirror side of the material. it is very important to remove it by pulling slowly, parallel and close to the surface. that way you won't rip latex out of the spacings in between the material*


## Putting

<div class="note">For the following steps it is much easier to work with somebody who can give you hand.</div>


![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2667.jpg)
*put a log of wood in the middle of coated sheet as supporting structure during the putting process*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2668.jpg)
*put the strip of adhesive film on the log (adhesive side up) and fix it with tape at each end of the log*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2678.jpg)
*bend one half of the sheet towards the adhesive foil on the log so that it sticks there*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3021.jpg)
*bend the other half*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2684.jpg)
*start at one end putting both ends together*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2689.jpg)
*slowly moving up, triangle need to interlock*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2656.jpg)
*cut strip of latex textile 4cm x 95cm*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2915.jpg)
*apply a 4 cm wide strip contact glue to the bellow's seam.*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2709.jpg)
*apply contact glue on latex textile strip*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2724.jpg)
*When the glue has fully dried glue strip to seam by applying pressure with rubber roll.*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2731.jpg)
*bellow with proper applied strip*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2926.jpg)
*Apply latex with brush along the edges of the strip*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2922.jpg)
*spreading latex with fingertips*


## Folding

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3022.jpg)
*cut the edges of the short ribs at each side of the bellow*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3037.jpg)
*apply talcum evenly on surface*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_2972.jpg)

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_0264.jpg)
*Fold bellow*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3102.jpg)
*Completely folded bellow*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3239.jpg)
*Clamp the bellow over night so it will stay in folded position. It it not necessary to apply a lot of pressure. Just that its stable.*


## Glueing

<div class="note">While glueing in the metal frames at each end of the bellow work with another person. before glueing make sure metal parts are fat and dust free. Glue one frame at a time since the epoxy hardens quiet fast!</div>

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3301.jpg)
*Put metal frame inside the last fold of the bellow, make sure that the holes are in the same positions as in the bellow and apply a thin layer of epoxy in between the holes. Leave 1 cm space between holes and epoxy to make sure that no glue will go into the female screw thread.*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3305.jpg)
*Fold the end of the bellow around the metal.*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3307.jpg)
*take care that holes of metal frames and below are aligned.*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3312.jpg)
*Clamp bellow, not to apply a lot of pressure, rather to stabilise the last foldings of the bellow*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3314.jpg)
*let it sit until epoxy is hardened*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3481.jpg)
*apply latex on the naked metal edges at each end of the bellow*

![]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3491.jpg)
*done!*
