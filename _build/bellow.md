## auszeichnungen (h2 'doppelraute am anfang')

Weit hinten, hinter den Wortbergen, fern der Länder Vokalien und Konsonantien leben die Blindtexte. Abgeschieden wohnen sie in Buchstabhausen an der Küste des Semantik, eines großen Sprachozeans. Ein kleines Bächlein namens Duden fließt durch ihren Ort und versorgt sie mit den nötigen Regelialien. Es ist ein paradiesmatisches Land, in dem einem gebratene Satzteile in den Mund fliegen. Nicht einmal von der allmächtigen Interpunktion werden die Blindtexte beherrscht – ein geradezu unorthographisches Leben. Eines Tages aber beschloß eine kleine Zeile Blindtext, ihr Name war Lorem Ipsum, hinaus zu gehen in die weite Grammatik. (fließtext ohne auszeichnung)

## Laser-cutting
+ bond mirror film with cardboard before lasering!
+ load provided illustrator file ```bellow``` to your laser-cutter
+ try cut settings with test piece of mounted mirror-film on cardboard
+ laser-cut sheet
+ have the metal piece professionally produced, all holes with need to have a M3 female screw thread

## Prepairing Coating

**for the following steps it is recommended to work in pairs of two**

![](../images/bellow/IMG_2145.jpg)
*cut transfer adhesive film to 50 x 100cm*

![](../images/bellow/IMG_0415.jpg)
*removing film from paper, start at one courner and pull diagonal and parallel to surface*

![](../images/bellow/IMG_2164.jpg)
*One positions the transparent film parallel to the end of lasered sheet (mirrored side up!) the other is holding up the other end of the film. take care that the film has a more or less überstand at each side of the cardboard*

![use cloth pressing foil to cardboard, move slowly from one end of the cardboard to the other while brushing from left to right](../images/bellow/IMG_2480.jpg)

![transparent film properly mounted on sheet](../images/bellow/IMG_0459.jpg)

![cut moscito net to 50 x 100cm](../images/bellow/C0014T01.jpg)

![apply adhesive spray on cardboard](../images/bellow/IMG_2201.jpg)

![apply adhesive spray on moscito net](../images/bellow/IMG_1260.jpg)

wait about 10 min before mounting moscito net on cardboard, adhesive spray needs to be dry

![mounting moscito net on cardboard the same way as transparent adhesive film was mounted before, adjust position of net with hand if necessary, avoid wrinkles!](../images/bellow/IMG_2525.jpg)

![using a rubber role to apply even and pressure. Not time but amount of pressure matters with using adhesive spray](../images/bellow/IMG_1276.jpg)

## Coating

![tape material to working surface, it should be strapped under tension](../images/bellow/IMG_2619.jpg)

<span class="note">put on vynil gloves, and repeat coating three times. thin layers of latex are better, wait for one layer to fully dry until you apply the next layer. this takes more or less 2 hours.</span>

![pour more or less 300m of liquid latex on material](../images/bellow/IMG_2231.jpg)

![spread liquid latex on surface evenly](../images/bellow/IMG_2235.jpg)

![the more diagonal you hold the rubber spreader the easyer you can spread the latex into the moscito net](../images/bellow/IMG_1925.jpg)

![take care of the edges, they should be covered fully by latex](../images/bellow/IMG_1578.jpg)

![coated material, avoid dabs, if they happen spread them with your fingertip](../images/bellow/IMG_1574.jpg)



## Prepairing Putting

![dettach material from surface and cut allong the edges](../images/bellow/IMG_2099.jpg)

![](../images/bellow/IMG_2603.jpg)

![](../images/bellow/IMG_2395.jpg)

![cut wholes into material with punch (TODO: FOTO MACHEN)](../images/bellow/C0009T01.jpg)

![remove adhesive transfer film from the mirror side of the material. it is very important to remove it by pulling slowy and parallel to surface. that way you won't rip latex out of the spacings within the material](../images/bellow/IMG_2124.jpg)


## Putting

Again for the following steps it is much easier to work with somebody who can give you hand.


![put a log of wood in the middle of material as supporting structure during putting process](../images/bellow/IMG_2667.jpg)

![put the strip of adhesive film on the log (adhesive side up) and fix it with tape at each end of the log](../images/bellow/IMG_2668.jpg)

![bend one half of the sheet towards the adhesive foil on the log so that it sticks there](../images/bellow/IMG_2678.jpg)

![bend the other half](../images/bellow/IMG_3021.jpg)

![start at one end putting both ends together](../images/bellow/IMG_2684.jpg)

![slowly moving up, triangle need to interlock](../images/bellow/IMG_2689.jpg)

![cut strip of latex textile 4 x 95cm](../images/bellow/IMG_2656.jpg)

![apply a 4cm wide strip contact clue on bellowseam](../images/bellow/IMG_2915.jpg)

![apply contact clue on latex textile strip](../images/bellow/IMG_2709.jpg)

![when glue has fully dried glue strib to seam by applying pressure with rubber role](../images/bellow/IMG_2724.jpg)

![](../images/bellow/IMG_2731.jpg)

![apply latex with brush along the edges of strips](../images/bellow/IMG_2926.jpg)

![spreading latex with fingertips](../images/bellow/IMG_2922.jpg)


## Folding

![cut the edges of the short ribs at each side of the bellow](../images/bellow/IMG_3022.jpg)

![apply talcum evenly on surface](../images/bellow/IMG_3037.jpg)

![](../images/bellow/IMG_2972.jpg)

![fold bellow](../images/bellow/IMG_0264.jpg)

![](../images/bellow/IMG_3102.jpg)

![clamp bellow over night so it will stay in folded position. It it not necessary to apply a lot of pressure. Just that its stable.](../images/bellow/IMG_3239.jpg)


## Glueing

while glueing in the metall frames at each end of the bellow work with another person. before glueing make sure metall parts are fat and dust free. Glue one frame at a time since the epoxy hardens quiet fast!

![put metall frame inside the last fold of the bellow, make sure that the holes ar in the same positions as in the bellow and apply a thin layer of epoxy in between the holes. leave 1cm space between holes and epoxy to make sure that no glue will go into the female screw thread](../images/bellow/IMG_3301.jpg)

![fold the end of the bellow around the metall](../images/bellow/IMG_3305.jpg)

![](../images/bellow/IMG_3307.jpg)

![clamp bellow, not to apply a lot of pressure, rather to stabalise the last foldings of the bellow](../images/bellow/IMG_3312.jpg)

![let sit until epoxy is hardened](../images/bellow/IMG_3314.jpg)

![apply latex on the naked metal at each end of the bellow](../images/bellow/IMG_3481.jpg)

![done!](../images/bellow/IMG_3491.jpg)
