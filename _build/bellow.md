### Tools

This is a link to the Illustrator file for [lasercutting the bellow](/sources/bellow/LasercutBellow.ai).


![all you need](/images/bellow/IMG_1102.jpg)*tools and some of the materials*

TODO: Make picture of workspace (?)

### End Result

![folded bellow with metall frames](/images/bellow/IMG_4282.jpg)*folded bellow with metall frames*


## Laser-cutting
+ bond mirror film with cardboard before lasering!
+ load provided illustrator file ```bellow``` to your laser-cutter
+ try cut settings with test piece of mounted mirror-film on cardboard
+ laser-cut sheet
+ have the metal piece professionally produced, all holes with need to have a M3 female screw thread

## Metallframes

We highly recommend having all metall parts produced professionally according to our technical drawings.

## Prepairing Coating

<div class="note">For the following steps it is recommended to work in pairs of two.</div>

![](/images/bellow/IMG_2145.jpg)
*cut transfer adhesive film to 50 x 100cm*

![](/images/bellow/IMG_0415.jpg)
*removing film from paper, start at one courner and pull diagonal and parallel to surface*

![](/images/bellow/IMG_2164.jpg)
*One positions the transparent film parallel to the end of lasered sheet (mirrored side up!) the other is holding up the other end of the film. take care that the film has a more or less Ã¼berstand at each side of the cardboard*

![use cloth pressing foil to cardboard, move slowly from one end of the cardboard to the other while brushing from left to right](/images/bellow/IMG_2480.jpg)*use cloth pressing foil to cardboard, move slowly from one end of the cardboard to the other while brushing from left to right*

![apply adhesive spray on moscito net](/images/bellow/IMG_1260.jpg)*apply adhesive spray on moscito net*

<div class="note">Wait about 10 min before mounting moscito net on cardboard, adhesive spray needs to be dry</div>

## Coating

<div class="note">Put on vinyl gloves, and repeat coating three times. Thin layers of latex are better, wait for one layer to fully dry until you apply the next layer. This takes more or less 2 hours.</div>

![tape material to working surface, it should be strapped under tension](/images/bellow/IMG_2619.jpg)*tape material to working surface, it should be strapped with a proper amount of tension*

![pour more or less 300m of liquid latex on material](/images/bellow/IMG_2231.jpg)*pour more or less 300m of liquid latex on material*

![spread liquid latex on surface evenly](/images/bellow/IMG_2235.jpg)*spread liquid latex on surface evenly*

![the more diagonal you hold the rubber spreader the easyer you can spread the latex into the moscito net](/images/bellow/IMG_1925.jpg)*the more diagonal you hold the rubber spreader the easyer you can spread the latex into the moscito net*

![take care of the edges, they should be covered fully by latex](/images/bellow/IMG_1578.jpg)*take care of the edges, they should be covered fully by latex*

![coated material, avoid dabs, if they happen spread them with your fingertip](/images/bellow/IMG_1574.jpg)*coated material, avoid dabs, if they happen spread them with your fingertip*

![cut wholes into material with punch (TODO: FOTO MACHEN)](/images/bellow/C0009T01.jpg)*cut wholes into material with punch TODO: foto mit locheisen machen!*

![remove adhesive transfer film from the mirror side of the material. it is very important to remove it by pulling slowy and parallel to surface. that way you won't rip latex out of the spacings within the material](/images/bellow/IMG_2124.jpg)*remove adhesive transfer film from the mirror side of the material. it is very important to remove it by pulling slowy, parallel and close to the surface. that way you won't rip latex out of the spacings in between the material*


## Putting

<div class="note">For the following steps it is much easier to work with somebody who can give you hand.</div>


![put a log of wood in the middle of material as supporting structure during putting process](/images/bellow/IMG_2667.jpg)*put a log of wood in the middle of coated sheet as supporting structure during the putting process*

![bend one half of the sheet towards the adhesive foil on the log so that it sticks there](/images/bellow/IMG_2678.jpg)*bend one half of the sheet towards the adhesive foil on the log so that it sticks there*

## Glueing

<div class="note">While glueing in the metall frames at each end of the bellow work with another person. before glueing make sure metall parts are fat and dust free. Glue one frame at a time since the epoxy hardens quiet fast!</div>

![put metall frame inside the last fold of the bellow, make sure that the holes ar in the same positions as in the bellow and apply a thin layer of epoxy in between the holes. leave 1cm space between holes and epoxy to make sure that no glue will go into the female screw thread](/images/bellow/IMG_3301.jpg)*put metall frame inside the last fold of the bellow, make sure that the holes ar in the same positions as in the bellow and apply a thin layer of epoxy in between the holes. leave 1cm space between holes and epoxy to make sure that no glue will go into the female screw thread*

![fold the end of the bellow around the metall](/images/bellow/IMG_3305.jpg)*fold the end of the bellow around the metall*

![](/images/bellow/IMG_3307.jpg)*take care that holes of metall frames and below are aligned*

![let sit until epoxy is hardened](/images/bellow/IMG_3314.jpg)*let it sit until epoxy is hardened*
