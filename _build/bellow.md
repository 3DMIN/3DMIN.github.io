## Laser-cutting metal frames production.

<div class="note">Before laser-cutting, glue the mirror film to the cardboard.</div>

Load the provided file ```LasercutBellow.ai``` to your laser-cutter and try cut settings with a test piece of the material. Then, cut the sheet.

We got the metal frame professionally produced. All its holes need an M3 female screw threading.

![TODO: photo of laser-cut sheet and metal frames]()

## Coating preparation

<div class="note">You will need an assistant for the following steps.</div>

Cut transfer adhesive film to about ```50cm x 100cm``` and remove its protective sheet starting at one corner, pulling diagonally and almost parallel to the surface.

While one person positions the transparent film parallel to the end of the cut cardboard (mirrored side up!), the other holds up the other end.

<div class="note">The film should protrude the cardboard on every side.</div>

## Coating

<div class="note">Put on vinyl gloves, and repeat coating three times. Thin layers of latex are better, wait for one layer to fully dry until you apply the next layer. This takes more or less 2 hours.</div>

## Glueing

<div class="note">While glueing in the metall frames at each end of the bellow work with another person. before glueing make sure metall parts are fat and dust free. Glue one frame at a time since the epoxy hardens quiet fast!</div>
