## Filling


{% comment %}Holes and dents in the box' surface can be closed by the application of filling material.
For the 2K filling material to work, its two components needs to be mixed together thoroughly. For this, take some of the first material and put it to a wooden surface, then add a small amount of the second material and mix the two components with a spatula. 

<div class="note">Mix only as much as you will be able to use within the next 10 minutes</div>

Apply it with a scraper to the groves and cracks and remove excess immediately.

<div class="note">Remove excess material when it is still fresh; dry material gets very hard and therefore takes a lot of time to sand away.</div>

Use a 2K putty to fill gaps and dents in between parts or on surface.

<div class="note">
To prepare the putty, follow the instructions on its package. 
It is a good idea to apply putty in between layers of grounding coats, because most filling pastes need to be covered with a primer before applying the final paint. 
For really big gaps you can apply putty even before the applying first layer of filler.

If necessary, repeat this procedure after applying the first layer of filler.

## Sanding

The lower box needs to be sanded in between applying layers of primer. 
The first layer of primer should be sanded with P240 to smooth out areas of redundant putty. 
For the second layer, you should use P400 (i.e. much finer) sanding paper. Fold it in half and sand by hand.

<div class="note">
Do not worry if you sand off fill material at certain areas. You have to apply a second layer anyway.     
</div>

## Filing

The lid of the box should get on and off easily. To ensure this, it is necessary to file away parts of its teeth. 

Fix the lid in a vise and carefully file away parts of the teeth with a flat file.
The use of a square file supports you to keep a right angle also in the corners.

<div class="note">Be careful when taking away the material and be prepared to try several times if the lid fits snug. It is not possible to re-apply filed-off material.</div>

## Taping

Before varnishing, tape needs to be applied carefully to every area that is not supposed to be covered by varnish. This includes the surfaces where the capacitive sensors will be attached to, the screw holes (top part and lower box) and the area where the LiPo-charger will be glued to.

## Wet Sanding


Wet sanding is necessary between applying layers of filler and varnish on all 3D printed plastic parts. 
Do not sand after applying the plastic primer! Depending on which spray putty you use, you probably do not have to sand either.

![start sanding the 3D printed parts with P400 after you have applied the plastic primer, spray putty and a first layer of filler. sand wet, meaning that you should stick the sanding paper into water every once in a while and use an acrylic glass bloc to fold sanding paper around.

## Varnishing top parts

Before varnishing 3D printed parts plastic primer needs to be applied, otherwise the varnish wont stick to the surface. Wait approximately for 30min (see instructions on primer). Do not sand! Directly apply spray putty afterwards. In general: When you spray paint it is always a good idea to apply two thinner layers than on thicker layer. Paint tends to drip and leaves unpleasant noses on the surface. Same thing holds true for spray putty and filler, even they have less viscosity. Spray upright surfaces from bottom to top. Keep even distance and angle to surfaces and move from left to right with an approximate even speed. It is all about even layer thickness especially when it comes to sanding later on!

## Varnishing lower box

The lower box needs to be ground coated with a a appropriate filler. This closes the the surface and protects coloured varnish from sinking into the pores of the material. Similar to the plastic parts filler should rather be applied in several thin layers than in one thick layer which will take forever to dry.
