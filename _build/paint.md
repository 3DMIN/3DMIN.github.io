## Filling

Use a 2K putty to fill gaps and dents in between parts or on surface.

<span class="note">
To prepare the putty, follow the instructions on its package. 
It is a good idea to apply putty in between layers of grounding coats, because most filling pastes need to be covered with a primer before applying the final paint. 
For really big gaps you can apply putty even before the applying first layer of filler.

## Sanding

The lower box needs to be sanded in between applying layers of primer. 
The first layer of primer should be sanded with P240 to smooth out areas of redundant putty. 
For the second layer, you should use P400 (i.e. much finer) sanding paper. Fold it in half and sand by hand.

<span class="note">
Do not worry if you sand off fill material at certain areas. You have to apply a second layer anyway.

## Taping

Before varnishing, tape needs to be applied carefully to every area that is not supposed to be covered by varnish. This includes the surfaces where the capacitive sensors will be attached to, the screw holes (top part and lower box) and the area where the LiPo-charger will be glued to.

## Wet Sanding


Wet sanding is necessary between applying layers of filler and varnish on all 3D printed plastic parts. 
Do not sand after applying the plastic primer! Depending on which spray putty you use, you probably do not have to sand either.

## Varneshing Top Parts

Before varnishing 3D printed parts plastic primer needs to be applied, otherwise the varnish wont stick to the surface. Wait approxamately for 30min (see instructions on primer). Do not sand! Directly apply spray putty afterwards. In general: When you spray paint it is always a good idea to apply two thinner layers than on thicker layer. Paint tends to drip and leaves unpleasant noses on the surface. Same thing holds true for spray putty and filler, even they have less viscosity. Spray upright surfaces from bottom to top. Keep even distance and angle to surfaces and move from left to right with an approximate even speed. It is all about even layer thickness especially when it comes to sanding later on!

## Varneshing Lower Box

The lower box needs to be ground coated with a a appropriate filler. This closes the the surface and protects coloured varnish from sinking into the pores of the material. Similiar to the platic parts filler should rather be applyed in several thin layers than in one thick layer which will take forever to dry.
