<span class="note">You should use a 2K putty to fill gaps and dents in between parts or on surface. To prepare putty follow instructions on package. It is a good idea to apply putty in between layers of grounding coates, because most filling pastes need to be covered with a primer before applying final colour. For really big gaps you can apply putty even before applying first layer of filler.</span>

## sanding

+ sanding block (cork)
+ sandpaper (P240, P400)

<span class="note">The lower box needs to be sanded in between applying layers of ground coat. The first layer should be sanded with P240 beacause you will have to sand off redundant putty. For the second layer you should use P400 paper, fold it in half and sand by hand.</span>

## Taping

<span class="note">before varnishing tape needs to be applyed carefully on every area which is not supposed to be covered by varnish. This includes surfaces where capacativ sensors will be attached to, holes for screws (top part and lower box) and the area where the lipo-charger will be glued on.</span>

## Wet Sanding

+ sanding block (cork, acrylic resin)
+ sandpaper (P200, P400, P600)
+ bowl of water
+ papertowels



Wet sanding sanding is necessary between applying layers of filler and varnish on all 3D printed plastic parts. Do not sand after applying the plastic primer! Depending on which spray putty you use you probably wont have to sand either.

![start sanding the 3D printed parts with P400 after you have applied the plastic primer, spray putty and a first layer of filler. sand wet, meaning that you should stick the sanding paper into water everey once in a while and use an acylic glas bloc to fold sandin paper around.

## Varneshing Top Parts

Before varnishing 3D printed parts plastic primer needs to be applied, otherwise the varnish wont stick to the surface. Wait approxamately for 30min (see instructions on primer). Do not sand! Directly apply spray putty afterwards. In general: When you spray paint it is always a good idea to apply two thinner layers than on thicker layer. Paint tends to drip and leaves unpleasant noses on the surface. Same thing holds true for spray putty and filler, even they have less viscosity. Spray upright surfaces from bottom to top. Keep even distance and angle to surfaces and move from left to right with an approximate even speed. It is all about even layer thickness especially when it comes to sanding later on!

## Varneshing Lower Box

The lower box needs to be ground coated with a a appropriate filler. This closes the the surface and protects coloured varnish from sinking into the pores of the material. Similiar to the platic parts filler should rather be applyed in several thin layers than in one thick layer which will take forever to dry.
