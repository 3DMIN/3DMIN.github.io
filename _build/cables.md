*Cut nine 3cm long pieces from the acryllic rod.*

![Poke a rod through one of the holes of the cable (only to every second hole) and add shrinking tube on both ends. Be sure to leave just enough space for the rod to move freely.](../images/cables/IMG_3959.jpg)

![Add layers of shrinking tube until the rod ends are slightly thicker than the cable going around the rod.](../images/cables/IMG_3991.jpg)
*Add layers of shrinking tube until the rod ends are slightly thicker than the cable going around the rod.*

![The resulting hinge should be easy to turn around and the ribbon cable should be slightly less thick than its outer parts.](../images/cables/IMG_3984.jpg)
