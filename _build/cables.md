![Add layers of shrinking tube until the rod ends are slightly thicker than the cable going around the rod.]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3991.jpg)
*Add layers of shrinking tube until the rod ends are slightly thicker than the cable going around the rod.*

![The resulting hinge should be easy to turn around and the ribbon cable should be slightly less thick than its outer parts.]({{ page.imagedir }}/IMG_3984.jpg)
*The resulting hinge should be easy to turn around and the ribbon cable should be slightly less thick than its outer parts.*


## Assembling cable into bellow

<div class="note">For this part, you need the completed bellow and four hands.</div>

Use the bellow to measure to which folds the hinges should be attached to. 
Its connection points should be equally spread out.
We put them roughly at every 3rd to 4th element.

Get help from another person to fix the bellow and attach the cable hinges to its inside folds with tape.
This can be quite tricky and needs some time and concentration.
