## Attaching wires

Attach the TRS plug to the preamp with a 3-core wire. 
Ribbon cable works best.
Attach microphones and a male-header in a similar fashion.

## Board mounting


Carefully insert the microphones to their rubber shock-mount.
Mount the preamp with the M3 nuts to the four screws of the valves system.
It might be needed to add some tape to increase their diameter for them to sit reasonably tight.
