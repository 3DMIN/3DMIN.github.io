PushPull is the first instrument prototype created as part of the 3DMIN project. It features a digital as well as analog control elements, most prominently a bellow made from cardboard. Sound synthesis combines analogue sound generation with digital sound manipulation. Moving the hand piece activates the bellow: hand movements restricted by the limitations of the bellow turn into gestures and create air flow over a microphone. Inertial sensors in the hand piece together with a thumb stick allow for continuous sound shaping, while four buttons complete the setup to trigger changes or change between synthesis engines.
